# CS50AI Portfolio

This repository contains my personal solutions and implementations for [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), offered by Harvard University. The course introduces foundational concepts in artificial intelligence through hands-on projects.

## ‚úÖ Completed Projects

### üé≠ Degrees of Separation
- Finds the shortest connection path between two actors using **Breadth-First Search** (BFS).
- Parses large CSV files (`people.csv` and `movies.csv`) to construct a graph of actors and movies.
- Given two actor names, it returns the shortest chain of co-starred films linking them.

### ‚ùå Tic-Tac-Toe AI
- Implements an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the **Minimax algorithm**.
- The AI always plays optimally and never loses, whether it plays first or second.
- Reinforces concepts in **game trees**, recursion, and adversarial search.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Graph search algorithms (BFS, Minimax)
- Data structures (sets, dictionaries, trees)
- File parsing (CSV)
- Recursive reasoning and decision-making

## üå± Goals with This Repository
This portfolio is part of my journey to:
- Deepen my understanding of AI principles
- Practice solving real-world problems with code
- Build a set of projects I can share with recruiters and collaborators
