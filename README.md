# CS50AI Portfolio

This repository contains my personal solutions and implementations for [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), offered by Harvard University. The course introduces foundational concepts in artificial intelligence through hands-on projects.

## ‚úÖ Completed Projects

### üé≠ Degrees of Separation
- Finds the shortest connection path between two actors using **Breadth-First Search** (BFS).
- Parses large CSV files (`people.csv` and `movies.csv`) to construct a graph of actors and movies.
- Given two actor names, it returns the shortest chain of co-starred films linking them.

### ‚ùå Tic-Tac-Toe AI
- Implements an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the **Minimax algorithm**.
- The AI always plays optimally and never loses, whether it plays first or second.
- Reinforces concepts in **game trees**, recursion, and adversarial search.

### üß† Minesweeper AI
- Builds a logical AI agent that can play Minesweeper by reasoning about the board.
- Uses **propositional logic**, **inference rules**, and **subset checking** to identify safe moves.
- Demonstrates basic **knowledge representation** and **constraint satisfaction**.

### üß© Knights and Knaves
- Solves logical puzzles involving characters who are either **knights** (always tell the truth) or **knaves** (always lie).
- Translates characters' statements into **propositional logic expressions**.
- Uses **model checking** to deduce the role (knight or knave) of each character based on their statements.
- Inspired by logic puzzles from Raymond Smullyan‚Äôs book *‚ÄúWhat is the Name of This Book?‚Äù*.

### üåê PageRank
- Implements the **PageRank** algorithm to rank web pages by importance.
- Two approaches:
  1. **Sampling** ‚Äî simulate random page visits to approximate ranks.
  2. **Iterative** ‚Äî repeatedly apply the PageRank formula until convergence.
- Reinforces concepts in **probability**, **graph traversal**, and **algorithm convergence**.

### üß¨ Heredity
- Uses **Bayesian networks** to determine the probability of individuals having a genetic trait.
- Calculates probabilities for:
  - Having 0, 1, or 2 copies of a specific gene.
  - Exhibiting a given trait.
- Practices **Bayesian inference**, **conditional probability**, and **probabilistic reasoning**.
